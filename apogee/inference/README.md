<hr>

## Overview

Most traders believe crypto is random, but deep learning scaling laws suggest otherwise. Apogée is an open-source research initiative exploring the **scaling laws of crypto market forecasting**. While financial markets are often assumed to be unpredictable, modern deep learning suggests that increasing data and compute could uncover measurable predictability.
Our goal is to **quantify how many bits of future price movement can be inferred** from historical candlestick data.
